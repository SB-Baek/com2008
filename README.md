# University Admissions System

## About
This project attempts to simulate a university admissions system where students can register for their chosen degrees. All users use the admissions interface to view/edit information about themselves or other users. Students
can view information about their courses (e.g. what modules they're taking, what grades they got, etc.),
whereas admins, registrars and teachers can view and edit information about students.

The system was written in Java using MySQL to store all information and simulates the software development process, from initial conception to having written fully tested software. Requirements from a design brief were analysed and modelled using UML diagrams aiding the developers in understanding stakeholders, actors, initial requirements, GUI design and database schema. 

## Useage

Ensure Java 8.0+ is installed and download the jar file.
